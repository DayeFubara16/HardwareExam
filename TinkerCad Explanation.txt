The attached TinkerCAD diagram that I have included in this repo is the basis of which I built my duck controller. 

As can be seen, the diagram includes the use of 2 buttons, a buzzer, as well as a TinkerCAD washer/potentiometer,
which will simulate the use of a joystick in this instance. It is important to note that an additional button is included,
however, this diagram is STRICTLY for the demo process, and is not included in the final build.

The diagram is pretty basis and works as needed. The two buttons operate as a jump and a attack the hunter. The washer operates a joystick,
allowing movement and the buzzer will light up and make a duck hurt sound, pressing the button in this demo will do that as well,
as that is the idea going forward.
