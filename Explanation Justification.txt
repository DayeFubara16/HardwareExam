Components 
The components are went for were pretty basic but are able to create an experience that the player can properly enjoy.
I choose a buzzer, as I wanted a haptic feedback that the player could feel in the controller when the hunter hit them. 
The addition of a joystick was evident and allowed me to consider the use movement so that the player was able to control the duck.
The 2 buttons allowed for the use of attacking the hunter, a delayed moved that the player can use after surving the barrage 
of attacks from the hunter, as well as a jump button in order to ensure that the player had something in their arsenal
to defend against. I had also initially thought about the idea of including an LED, but held off on it as it would only further complicate my process.

Assembly
The assembly of my controller includes the use of a duck head shaped controller and a few holes to show off the buzzer, joystick as well as the buttons. 
The idea was to keep it as simple as possible, however, I am entirely able to recognize that the size is not ideal.
The technical drawings show off the dimensions of the object, as well as the necessary parts. 

TinkerCAD
The attached TinkerCAD diagram that I have included in this repo is the basis of which I built my duck controller. 

As can be seen, the diagram includes the use of 2 buttons, a buzzer, as well as a TinkerCAD washer/potentiometer,
which will simulate the use of a joystick in this instance. It is important to note that an additional button is included,
however, this diagram is STRICTLY for the demo process, and is not included in the final build.

The diagram is pretty basis and works as needed. The two buttons operate as a jump and a attack the hunter. The washer operates a joystick,
allowing movement and the buzzer will light up and make a duck hurt sound, pressing the button in this demo will do that as well,
as that is the idea going forward.
